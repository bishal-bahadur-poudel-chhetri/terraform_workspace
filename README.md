Terraform Workspaces allow us to manage the same infrastructure configuration across multiple environments (e.g., dev, prod) with isolated state files. This approach ensures you donâ€™t need to duplicate your code for each environment.
Key Benefits:

State Isolation: Separate infrastructure configurations for each environment.

Reusability: Use the same configuration files to apply to multiple environments.

Environment-Specific Configuration: Configure resources differently depending on the selected workspace.
